# Financial Industry Ontologies Repository

Welcome to the Financial Industry Ontologies Repository. This repository houses a collection of ontologies in RDF Schema (RDFS) format, specifically designed to define and illustrate vocabularies and their interconnections within the financial sector. These ontologies serve as a fundamental resource for enhancing semantic web technologies, fostering interoperability, and enabling more effective data integration in financial services.

## Overview

Our ontologies are crafted to support data scientists, and AI developers who are looking to harness structured knowledge for private, non-commercial applications. The models provided here represent a broad spectrum of financial concepts, relationships, and terms that are crucial for a deeper understanding and operation within the financial domain.

## Repository Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- **/ontologies/**: Contains all the ontology files in RDFS format.
- **/examples/**: Sample data and usage examples demonstrating how to implement and query the ontologies.
- **/docs/**: Documentation related to ontology concepts, vocabulary, and usage guidelines.
